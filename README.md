JavaScript training repository used to practice and learn by solving some common katas.

### List of katas:

* [ES6 Katas.](http://es6katas.org/)

### Executing tests:

This project contains some tests written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). You can easily run the tests by executing:

```
yarn test //Executes every test.
yarn test -w //Waits for code changes and executes every test.
yarn test -g "YOUR_REG_EX" //Executes tests matching with the regex passed as param.
```

### Packaging:

This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [babel](https://babeljs.io) in order to pack a simple ``bundle.js`` file, with all the repository code, fully backward compatible with some old JavaScript versions. If you want to pack all this code into a single file you can easily do it by just running:

```
yarn webpack
```

### Linter:

This repository uses [eslint]() in order to check if the js code written matchers the checkstyle configured. You can check if everything is ok by executing ``yarn eslint src`` and automatically fix the issues by executing ``yarn eslint --fix src`` if needed.
